              As the Internet has spread to every part of our professional and personal lives, society has changed. We are at a tipping point. A generation of people have been educated using the web. They grew up with email. They are entertained by YouTube and Facebook. They do not buy newspapers. The TV is only on in the background. Content has fragmented and advertising must compete with thousands of other distractions. We have become more permissive with our information in exchange for convenience, insight or entertainment.

              We now have the ability to share who our friends are, what we do with our spare time, what we think, feel and want, what we search for and what websites we visit. We use devices to record how many steps we take, prove that we have been to the gym and confirm that we are safe drivers. We are willing and able to capture and share data to enhance our lives and make or save money.

              When we think about this data, what would give us the ultimate insights? What would tell us where we really stand? SocialCrunch is focused on the next logical step in this evolution. How do we go deeper? How do we collect the psychographic data that says who we are and why we do what we do? How do we collect the right information in a way that protects and respects privacy; entertains and does not isolate? How do we deliver insights that make us smirk and not cry?

              %br
              SocialCrunch will provide answers to these questions. The more we know about where we stand; the more we become aware. The more we understand and have perspective the more we can enhance ourselves, both individualy and as a society.
